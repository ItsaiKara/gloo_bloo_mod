# Gloo bloo (temporary name) the ocean mod
## What is it
A minecraft **fabric** mod, currently develloped for minecraft 1.20.1.
It's purpose is to improve the ocean life, by adding mobs, biomes, _(WIP) shaders_, and various ressources.
It's been worked on by AiKa, a beginner in mincraft modding but confirmed dev.

## Can I help ?
Sure, I'd be glad to work with other people, since I'm barely starting modding any help would be appreciated you can find the discord here: 
Currently looking for people with experience modding to guide me, contribute, or give ideas.

## How do I play the mod ? 
There is currently no stable build so you'll need to compile it yourself

## Can I use the mod for my modpack ?
No. Because there is no stable build yet (I'll update this when we are ready)
