# Using git
## Setup
Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (bash)

Open git bash (or git cmd)

```shell
cd "<path_to_desired_folder>"
```
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ItsaiKara/gloo_bloo_mod.git
```
Log in github account if needed

Code should now be downloaded, but you need to go to the right branch

```shell
git checkout <branch_name> # here dev_1.20.1
```


## Changed code how to upload it?

First of all make sure you are in the right folder

```shell
git status
```

If you see the files you changed, you are in the right folder (otherwise use cd to navigate to the right folder)

Add the files you changed to the commit, **only the files you changed**

```shell
git add <file_name> <file_name2> <file_name3> ...
```

You can check again with git status if you added the right files

Now check in the git status if you are in the right branch (should not be main or dev_1.20.1).

To create a new git branch (a branch is a fork in the code) use:

```shell
git checkout -b <branch_name> # should be dev_1.20.1_<name>
```

New branch is created and you can now commit your changes

```shell
git commit -m "<commit_message>" 
#If it's a feature use "feat: <commit_message>"
# If it's a bug fix use "fix: <commit_message>"
# If it's a documentation change use "docs: <commit_message>"
# If it's a code refactor use "refactor: <commit_message>"
# If it's a work in progress use "wip: <commit_message>"
```
__Note:__ The prefix is just for better overview, it's highly recommended to use it

Now you can push your changes to github
```shell
git push # You may be asked to change upstream source, just follow the instructions
```

Changes should now be uploaded to github, you can check it on github.com.
You can now create a pull request on github.com to merge your changes into the dev_1.20.1 branch if you are done with your changes.

## How to update your local code?

You may need to pull the latest changes from github.com to your local code, use:

```shell
git pull
```

## How to change a branch?
```shell
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## Where does the models, textures and animation go ?
src/main/ressources/assets/gloo_bloo/<models/|textures/|animations/>
Make sure to be in the same folder and name you items correctly
